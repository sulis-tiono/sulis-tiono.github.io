>Investor Tips: Seize The Moment  
--<cite>RTI, Literacy News</cite>

Success in the stock market isn't measured by the mere actions of buy "low" and sell "high". There is no such things as a foolproof system to predict the right time to buy or sell stocks.

The only thing to do is to seize the moment. Think fast and follow through with immediate action, only then you shall achieve success.
